# Things to remember

This document is just for making lists of things I don't want to forget.  So
many times I find something cool online or in the documentation and then forget
it later that day.  Let's start documenting those things here!

## List of installs for new setup:
- Arch Linux (container on Crostini)
- neovim
- curl (or wget?)
- tmux
- fish
- git

## Vim commands to remember

### Normal Mode
g_ = end of line without carriage return
gn = "go next" (visually select most recent search term)



### Insert Mode



### Command Mode

<C-r> = refer to register (e.g. <C-r>0 is grab from register 0)
        * also refers to entering expression (=) or word under cursor (<C-w)
<C-w> = refer to word under cursor (vim knows where cursor is still at above)
